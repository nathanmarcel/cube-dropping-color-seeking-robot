# Mechatronics Cube Dropping, Color Seeking Robot Project

This project was done for a mechatronics lab in which the goal was to design a robot that could take in one of three different color inputs, navigate a grid (shown below), and drop a foam cube on the inputted target color. The code was written mainly in Arduino (and some C++ for the color sensor & motor control), and is pretty specific to the specific parts we bought so I mean if you want to replicate it good luck but it took a really long time to build this and it didn't even work consistently in the end.

## Here's the maze:

## And here is what our robot looked like:
